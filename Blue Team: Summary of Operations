### Network Topology
_TODO: Fill out the information below._

The following machines were identified on the network:
- Name of VM 1
  - **Operating System**:
  - **Purpose**:
  - **IP Address**:
- Name of VM 2
  - **Operating System**:
  - **Purpose**:
  - **IP Address**:
- Etc.

### Description of Targets
_TODO: Answer the questions below._

The target of this attack was: `Target 1` (TODO: IP Address).

Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:

### Monitoring the Targets

Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:

#### Name of Alert 1
_TODO: Replace `Alert 1` with the name of the alert._

Alert 1 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: TODO
  - **Threshold**: TODO
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: TODO
  - **Reliability**: TODO: Does this alert generate lots of false positives/false negatives? Rate as low, medium, or high reliability.

#### Name of Alert 2
Alert 2 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: TODO
  - **Threshold**: TODO
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: TODO
  - **Reliability**: TODO: Does this alert generate lots of false positives/false negatives? Rate as low, medium, or high reliability.

#### Name of Alert 3
Alert 3 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: TODO
  - **Threshold**: TODO
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: TODO
  - **Reliability**: TODO: Does this alert generate lots of false positives/false negatives? Rate as low, medium, or high reliability.

_TODO Note: Explain at least 3 alerts. Add more if time allows._
